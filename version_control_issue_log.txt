File 'csv_files/Chabot_12-15-2018.csv' gives a UTF-8 parsing error at position 12,
which makes it un-readable by pandas.read_csv.  To fix, I replaced 
everything in the first row with 'MODIFIED OFFICIAL' in cell A1, then 
saved the file as CSV / UTF-8 in Excel for Windows 10.

File 'csv_files/Chabot_05-12-2018.csv' has a column heading 'Nameum' where 'Name'
should be.  To avoid having to make a complicated parser, I simply replaced
'Nameum' with 'Name' at cell A2, then saved the file as CSV / UTF-8 in Excel
for Windows 10.

File 'csv_files/Chabot_08-11-2018.csv' has a unique placement of data.
Instead of putting 'POOL B' below 'POOL A', 'POOL B' was placed to the 
right of 'POOL A' starting in Column K.  The parser misses 'POOL B' 
entirely as a result.  A quick check showed this issue affects only 
this sheet, so I have moved the data from cell K3 to cell A22, so that 
the parser works correctly, then saved the file as CSV / UTF-8 in Excel
for Windows 10.
