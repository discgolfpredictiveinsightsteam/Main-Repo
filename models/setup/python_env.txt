For maximum stability, the conda-forge channel is used as much as possible.  This
 may be unnecessary as the keras install (which does not work with conda-forge) 
will override most conda-forge packages, but until tested otherwise, we'll err on 
the side of maximum compatibility.  We give Jupyter the lowest priority because 
if something breaks, we'd rather it be the notebook.
